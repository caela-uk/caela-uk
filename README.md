## Oi mate hello there 🫵

🇬🇧 - I am situated in England, as you might be able to tell from my delightful vocabulary

💻 - You see, I'm not *great* with many programming languages *(Python is my best lmfao)* but I am okay at overall software like Linux and stuff, my skills are mainly in design and putting stuff together

🖌️ - I'm pretty good with tools like Figma and graphic design overall, while I'm not capable of doing anything too complex or well... not modern, I do have a very good eye for what looks good and doesn't- it comes naturally to me but apparently that's not normal so whatever 🤷‍♀️ people tell me I'm good at what I do

⛏️ - If I do say so myself, I am also pretty bloody good at making Modpacks with FancyMenu and SpiffyHUD layouts for Minecraft Java Edition

🧈 - I make a very ambitious Minecraft performance and QoL modpack and soon to be launcher called [Butterium](https://modrinth.com/modpack/butterium) with all-custom GUI, HUD and functionality
